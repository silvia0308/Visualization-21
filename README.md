# Temporal Visualization from Cosmology Simulation
Project for Visualization 2021 Spring @ ETH Zurich [[Report Link]()] <br/>
<br/>
This repo contains the source code to support temproal visualization taking cosmology simulation data as inputs.
- Particle type
- Particle attributes
- Cosmic web
- GUI

Please build the code properly with cmake and vtk installed.


## Particle attributes

- Visualize SPH results with direct volume rendering
Run ```particle_attributes/visual_sph/SimpleRayCast.cxx```, follow the instructions to input sph result path, attribute and time.
